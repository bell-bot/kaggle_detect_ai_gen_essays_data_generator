                You will now be asked to provide a value definition for the missing placeholders one by one.
            
                Unless you want to use the same value for each essay, use the python faker package ({FAKER_DOCS_LINK}).
                To call a faker method, use the already initialised `fake` object. E.g. to generate a fake name, enter fake.name()
                
                The placeholder dictionary contains a number of variables that are used to build the replacement values. 
                Use the same name as the pre-defined value if you want the placeholder substitution to be consistent within 
                an essay. 
                For instance, the placeholder dictionary contains a variable `\"your_last_name\"` which returns a random fake
                last name and is used to build the value for the `\"name\"` placeholder. You may have a missing placeholder 
                called `\"yoursistername\"` and want to use the same last name in \"yoursistername\" as in the `\"name\"` placeholder.
                When prompted, you could provide the value in the following way:
                \"yoursistername\": f\"{'{fake.first_name()}'} {'{your_last_name}'}\"
                The example above creates a string composed of a randomly generated and last name where the last name will
                be consistent across the essay.
                
                Here is a list of the variables defined in the placeholder dictionary:
                
                your_first_name = fake.first_name()
                your_last_name = fake.last_name()
